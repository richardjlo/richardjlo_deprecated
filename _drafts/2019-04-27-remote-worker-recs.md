# Recommendations for remote workers

### Money
* [Charles Schwab Checking Account][schwab] - free ATM withdrawals worldwide with no minimium balances or any additional fees. Also has excellent, 24/7, US-based customer support. While technically a brokerage firm, Schwab offers an excellent free checking account for their customers. I've also checked their exchange rates and they are usually the same as Google's exchange rate. 
* [Chase Sapphire Reserve][chase-sapphire-reserve] - includes a free Priority Pass membership which provides lounge access to loads of airport lounges around the world. The cashback bonuses and travel rewards are also excellent. 
* [Transferwise][transferwise] - cheaply transfer money internationally. Cheaper than Paypal and bank wires.

### Gear
* [Roost Laptop Stand][roost] - raise laptop stand closer to eye level. Is literally a back/neck saver.
* [Airpods][airpods] - the best wireless earphones (with built in mic) that I've found so far. 
* [Tile][tile] - surprisingly useful device for finding lost items.

### Software
* [Google Voice][google-voice] - get a free US number. Make and receive free calls and SMS to the US while you're abroad. 
* [NordVPN][nord] - a reliable VPN provider that even works in China. I use this to protect my internet connection while on public wifi networks and access websites from a US ip address. Works on your computer and phone. 
* [Krisp][krisp] - noise cancelling software. Great for blocking out background noise while you are on a call. 
* [1Password][1password] - very user-friendly password manager. 
* [Skype][skype] - I always maintain a small balance in case I need to call local numbers while traveling. Their rates are very reasonable and you can call any local number provided that you have an internet connection. 
* [Spotify][spotify] - listen to music / podcasts without ads. 

### Housing
* [Airbnb][airbnb]
* [Booking.com][booking]
