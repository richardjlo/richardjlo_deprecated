Hey everyone,

Today's post is about the things that we want to do but never actually do. 

I've been meaning to publish an update for the longest time, but as you can tell, I haven't gotten around to it. A lot has happened and I wish I had posted more regularly, but alas, I can't change the past. What I can do, is try to change the future.

Before we get started, I wanted to talk about behaviors. I categorize behaviors into a few buckets based on their regularity:

1. One-time behaviors - a behavior that you do without any regularity. This could be something that you literally do one time or something that you do once in a while. The key attribute is that these behaviors don't happen with any regular cadence or schedule. White water rafting would fall into this category for me. I've been a couple of times in my life and may or may not do it again.
2. Finite behaviors - a behavior that you do regularly for a fixed period of time. For example, taking a Spanish class for 3 months would fit into this category.
3. Indefinite behaviors (Habits) - perhaps better known as habits, these are behaviors that you do with regularity indefinitely. 

In terms of priorities, I have spent most of my energy in developing category #3 – my long term habits. When it comes to the other two categories, I have spent very little to no energy. 

Here's a quick summary of how I view each category and how satisfied I am with my efforts.

##### Category #3 (Indefinite behaviors – Habits)
Over time, I have honed my habits to a very specific list of behaviors. This is intentionally a short list so that I can more often than not accomplish these things daily.

My habits (listed in priority) are:

* Getting 8 hours of sleep
* Exercise (~ 60 min)
* Learn / Create - mostly fulfilled by the work that I do

##### Category #1 ( One-time behaviors )
I spend little to no effort shaping my one-time behaviors and so far, I'm pretty satisfied with the results. Having a picnic with friends, exploring an unfamiliar part of the city, or making a new dish all happen without much concerted effort and I'm cool with that.

##### Category #2 (Finite behaviors)
This is the category that I have the most trouble with. Similarly to one-time behaviors, I spend little to no effort on this category, however, in this case, I am not so happy with the result. I have a number of behaviors that fall into this category (e.g. writing, learning a language), but without any active effort on my part, they never seem to happen. 

My most successful efforts in this category have been signing up for a class or hiring a tutor. Aside from the financial cost of classes or tutors, I think it's time that I start experimenting with other ways to reliably do these types of behaviors.
