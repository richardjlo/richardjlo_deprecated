Updated on November 14, 2019 from Chiang Mai, Thailand ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­

**Projects that I'm working on**
* [Designstaq] (live)
  * Still my main gig. Designstaq is a a web design company that I started in 2016 that specializes in building Squarespace websites. We mostly work with individuals and small teams in the professional services industry (think speakers, authors, consultants, law firms, investment firms, etc.).
* [Software unboxing videos] (live)
  * I'm experimenting with creating content on YouTube. I've decided to focus on a very specific niche â€“ creating unboxing videos for B2B SAAS products. I know it's not the most *thrilling* space, but hey, all I need is [1,000 true fans] ðŸ˜‰ + affiliates in this space are ðŸ”¥
* [Tribe] (beta)
  * A web app that helps Digital Nomads know where their friends are planning to be. Interested in trying it out? [Sign up for our beta]
* [Nomad Hunt] (beta)
  * A crowd-sourced listing of the best products and services designed for Digital Nomads.  
 * [Bordr] (in-development)
   * The first legitimate, online-only way to get your AAA International Driving Permit (IDP). Yes, 'legitimate' is a notable feature here because there are a lot of fakes in this space.

**Past Projects**
* [Counter App] - A simple counter application that incorporates React, Redux, and Firestore.
* [rlo labs] - A collection of small programming projects I built to learn web development.
* [Chiang Mai City Recs] - My top recommendations for Chiang Mai, Thailand.
