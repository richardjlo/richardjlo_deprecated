# [Hunter S. Thompson’s Letter on Finding Your Purpose and Living a Meaningful Life]
> All advice can only be a product of the man who gives it. What is truth to one may be disaster to another.

> Whether to float with the tide, or to swim for a goal. It is a choice we must all make consciously or unconsciously at one time in our lives.

> The tragedy of life — is that we seek to understand the goal and not the man.

> When you were young, let us say that you wanted to be a fireman. I feel reasonably safe in saying that you no longer want to be a fireman. Why? Because your perspective has changed. It’s not the fireman who has changed, but you... So it would seem foolish, would it not, to adjust our lives to the demands of a goal we see from a different angle every day? 

> We do not strive to be firemen, we do not strive to be bankers, nor policemen, nor doctors. WE STRIVE TO BE OURSELVES. I don’t mean that we can’t BE firemen, bankers, or doctors— but that we must make the goal conform to the individual, rather than make the individual conform to the goal.

> Let’s assume that you think you have a choice of eight paths to follow (all pre-defined paths, of course). And let’s assume that you can’t see any real purpose in any of the eight. THEN— and here is the essence of all I’ve said— you MUST FIND A NINTH PATH.

> Beware of looking for goals: look for a way of life. Decide how you want to live and then see what you can do to make a living WITHIN that way of life.

> Is it worth giving up what I have to look for something better? I don’t know— is it? Who can make that decision but you? 

> it is not necessary to accept the choices handed down to you by life as you know it. There is more to it than that— no one HAS to do something he doesn’t want to do for the rest of his life.

> Artisans, say taxi drivers, prostitutes (a very, very old profession), carpenters, plumbers, tailors, and dentists, have some volatility in their income but are rather robust to a minor professional Black Swan, one that would bring their income to a complete halt. Their risks are visible. Not so with employees, who have no volatility, but can be surprised to see their income going to zero after a phone call from the personnel department. Employees’ risks are hidden.

> Variations also act as purges. Small forest fires periodically cleanse the system of the most flammable material, so this does not have the opportunity to accumulate. Systematically preventing forest fires from taking place “to be safe” makes the big one much worse.

> Motorists need the stressors and tension coming from the feeling of danger to feed their attention and risk controls, rather than some external regulator- fewer pedestrians die jaywalking than using regulated crossings.

> Take the situation in which you have a lot to lose and little to gain. If an additional quantity of wealth… would not benefit you, but you would feel great harm from the loss of an equivalent amount, you have an asymmetry. And it is not a good asymmetry; you are fragile.

> "The book-keeping of benefits is simple: it is all expenditure; if anyone returns it, that is clear gain; if he does not return it, it is not lost, I gave it for the sake of giving.” … He (Seneca) played a trick on fate: kept the good and ditched the bad; cut the downside and kept the upside.

> If I have to work, I find it preferable (and less painful) to work intensely for very short hours, then do nothing for the rest of the time, until I recover completely and look forward to a repetition, rather than being subjected to the tedium  of Japanese style low-intensity interminable office hours with sleep deprivation. Main course and dessert are separate.

> The teleological fallacy [is] the illusion that you know exactly where you are going, and that you knew exactly where you were going in the past, and that others have succeeded in the past by knowing where they are going.

> The rational flaneur is someone who, unlike a tourist, makes a decision at every step to revise his schedule, so he can imbibe things based on new information, what Nero was trying to practice in his travels, often guided by his sense of smell. The flaneur is not a prisoner of a plan. Tourism, actual or figurative, is imbued with the teleological illusion; it assumes completeness of vision and gets one locked into a hard-to-revise program, while the flaneur continuously - and, what is crucial, rationally - modifies his targets as he acquires information... The error of thinking you know exactly where you are going and assuming hat you know today what your preferences will be tomorrow has an associated one. It is the illusion of thinking that others, too, know where they are going, and that they would tell you what they want if you just asked them.

> Never ask people what they want, or where they want to go, or where they think they should go, or, worse, what they think they will desire tomorrow. The strength of the computer entrepreneur Steve Jobs was precisely in distrusting market research and focus groups - those based on asking people what they want - and following his own imagination. His modus was that people don’t know what they want until you provide them with it.

> Sour grapes…  is when someone convinces himself that the grapes he cannot reach are sour. You need to know whether you do not like the pursuit of money and wealth because you genuinely do not like it, or because you are rationalizing your inability to be successful at it.

> We see a high degree of academic research in countries that are wealthy and developed, leading us to think uncritically that research is the generator of wealth. In an epiphenomenon, you don’t usually observe A without observing B with it, so you are likely to think that A causes B, or that B causes A, depending on the cultural framework or what seems plausible to the local journalist.

> Theory should stay independent from practice and vice versa - and we should not extract academic economists from their campuses and put them in positions of decision making. Economics is not a science and should not be there to advice policy.

> “In theory there is no difference between theory and practice; in practice there is."

> We don’t put theories into practice. We create theories out of practice.

> I figured out how to select people on their ability to integrate socially with others while sitting around doing nothing and enjoying fuzziness. You select people their ability to hang around, as a filter, and studious people were not good at hanging around: they needed to have a clear task.

> People who build their strength using modern expensive gym machines can lift extremely large weights, show great numbers and develop impressive-looking muscles, but fail to lift a stone; they get completely hammered in a street fight by someone trained in more disorderly settings. Their strength is extremely domain-specific and their domain doesn’t’ exist outside of ludic-extremely organized-constructs.

> The minute I was bored with a book or a subject I moved to another one, instead of giving up on reading altogether - when you are limited to the school material and you get bored, you have a tendency to give up and do nothing or play hooky out of discouragement. The trick is to be bored with a specific book, rather than with the act of reading. 

>There is this error that things always have a reason that is accessible to us - that we can comprehend easily.

> The term green lumber refers to a story by authors Jim Paul and Brendan Moynihan in their book What I Learned Losing A Million Dollars, where a trader made a fortune trading lumber he thought was literally "green" rather than fresh cut. "This gets at the idea that a supposed understanding of an investment rationale, a narrative or a theoretical model is unhelpful in practical trading."

> Things break on a small scale all the time, in order to avoid large-scale generalized catastrophes.

> We are built to be dupes for theories. But theories come and go; experiences tays. Explanations change all the time, and have changed all the time in history (because of causal opacity, the invisibility of causes) with people involved in the incremental development of ideas thinking they always had a definitive theory; experience remains constant.

> If you take risks and face your fate with dignity, there is nothing you can do that makes you small; if you don’t take risks, there is nothing you can do that makes you grand, nothing. And when you take risks, insults by half-men (small men, those who don’t risk anything are similar to barks by nonhuman animals: you can’t feel insulted by a dog.

> Predicting without skin in the game can be as dangerous for others as unmanned nuclear plants without the engineer sleeping on the premises. Pilots should be on the plane... The second heuristic is that we need to build redundancy, a margin of safety, avoiding optimization, mitigating (even removing) asymmetries in our sensitivity to risk.

> The Talker’s Free option - 
> No opinion without risk… otherwise, you do not really have an opinion at all. You need to be earmarked as someone who has no downside for his opinion, with a special status in society, perhaps something below that of ordinary citizen. Commentators need to have a status below ordinary citizens. Regular citizens, at least, face the downside of their statements... I find it profoundly unethical to talk without doing, without exposure to harm, without having one’s skin in the game, without having something at risk. You express your opinion; it can hurt others (who rely on it), yet you insure no liability.
