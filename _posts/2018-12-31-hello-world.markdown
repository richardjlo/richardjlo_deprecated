When learning a new programming language, programmers typically write a very simple program that displays the words “Hello, World!” to the screen. The idea is that "Hello, World!" is your first milestone - making sure that everything is installed properly and that you understand the basics of the language.

Since I’m learning a new technology called [Jekkyl][jekyll] to host this blog, I figured “Hello, World!” would be an appropriate first post.
