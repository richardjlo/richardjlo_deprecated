When learning a new programming language, programmers typically write a very simple program that just generates the words “Hello, World” on the screen. The idea is that you want to write the minimal amount of code necessary to make sure that everything is installed properly and you understand the basics of the language.

Since I’m learning a technology called [Jekkyl][jekyll] to host this blog, I figured “Hello, World!” would be an appropriate first post.
