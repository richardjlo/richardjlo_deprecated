### What I'm working on
* [Designstaq] (status: live)
  * Still my main gig. Designstaq is a a web design company that I started in 2016 that specializes in building Squarespace websites for individuals and companies in the professional services industry (think speakers, authors, consultants, law firms, investment firms, etc.)

* [rlo labs (youtube channel)] (status: live)
  * I'm experimenting with creating content on YouTube. I've decided to focus on very specific niche â€“ B2B SAAS software. I know it's not the most *thrilling* space, but hey, all I need is [1,000 true fans] ðŸ˜‰ + affiliates in this space are ðŸ”¥

* [Tribe] (status: beta)
  * A web app that helps Digital Nomads know where their friends are planning to be. Interested? [Sign up for our beta]

* [Nomad Hunt] (status: beta)
  * A crowd-sourced listing of the best products and services designed for Digital Nomads.  

* [Bordr] (status: in-development, not live)
  * The first legitimate, online-only way to get your AAA International Driving Permit (IDP). Yes, 'legitimate' is a notable feature here because there are a lot of fakes in this space.
  
### Past Projects
* [Counter App] - a simple counter application that incorporates React, Redux, and Firestore.

* [rlo labs] - a collection of small programming projects I built to learn web development.

* [Chiang Mai City Recs] - my top recommendations for Chiang Mai, Thailand.
